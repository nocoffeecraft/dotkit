# Security Policy for DotKit

At DotKit, we take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow the steps below to responsibly report it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a potential security vulnerability in **DotKit**, please do not open an issue in the GitHub repository. Instead, please follow these steps:

1. **Email us directly. Provide as much information as possible to help us understand the vulnerability, including:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any relevant logs or proof of concept (PoC).
2. **Use a responsible disclosure method**. We will work with you to validate the issue and patch it as quickly as possible before public disclosure.

## Security Patches and Updates

Once a vulnerability is confirmed, we will:
- Assign a severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Could you provide a patch and release it as soon as possible?
- Publish a security advisory (if necessary) detailing the vulnerability and its resolution.

## Security Best Practices

We recommend the following security practices for users and contributors:
- Keep your DotKit installation up to date with the latest releases.
- Regularly review security advisories and patches from the DotKit repository.
- If contributing to the project, follow secure coding practices and conduct thorough security reviews.

## Acknowledgements

We thank the security community for their diligence in keeping DotKit secure. If you report a vulnerability, we will credit you in the release notes or the project's documentation (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
